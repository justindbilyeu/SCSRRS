# Cash on the Table

| Program | Who runs it | What you get | Typical $ |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Impact-Resistant Roof Credit** | Your insurer (mandated by TDI § 557.002) | –15 % to –35 % every renewal | $600–$1,200 yr |
| **Austin Energy Home Energy Savings** | City utility | Up to **$1 / ft²** for attic insulation + 0 % loan | $1,500–3,000 |
| **Federal 25C Credit** | IRS (Form 5695) | 30 % of insulation / radiant-barrier materials, up to $1,200 yr | $1,200 |
| **Federal 25D Solar ITC** | IRS (Form 5695) | 30 % of solar (or solar-ready upgrade) cost | $6–12 k |
| **TX Tax Code § 11.27** | County CAD | 100 % property-tax exclusion on solar value | $300-600 yr |

**Stack example — $400 k home**

* Year 0: −$6.7 k insurance credit + −$2.0 k Austin Energy + −$1.2 k 25C = **−$9.9 k up-front**  
* Years 1-20: −$2.2 k avg premium every year

That’s why SCSSRS breaks even as early as **Year 7**.
