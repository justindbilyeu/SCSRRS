# Frequently Asked Questions

**Does metal make the house hotter?**  
No. With the radiant barrier decking in SCSSRS, attic temps drop ≈ 25 °F vs old deck.

**Will hail just dent the roof and void the discount?**  
Carriers certify dents ≠ functional damage; the Class-4 credit stays as long as the roof remains watertight.

**Noise in rain?**  
With OSB + underlayment + insulation, dB levels match architectural shingles (Texas A&M sound test 2023).
