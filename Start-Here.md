# A Roof That Pays You Back â€” SCSSRS in 90 seconds

Texas hail averages **2 roof claims per decade** on shingles.  
A Class-4 metal roof under SCSSRS cuts those claims to nearly zero and earns a **-35 % insurance discount** every renewal (State Farm filing, TDI 2025).  
Over 20 years thatâ€™s **$43 800** back in your pocket on a $400 k Austin home.
